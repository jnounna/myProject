# Overview

This is a basic project for me to start to learn how to program with reactnative using node js and javascript.
The project is a basic allowance app.

This project is a basic project where you input two numbers. The first number is the number that you have for a budget
The second number that you put in is how much you spend to subtract from the allowance.
